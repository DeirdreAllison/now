# Now
Based off a blog post I wrote, here is what I am up to (s/o to [Austin Kleon](http://austinkleon.com/) who planted the seed in my head by posting artists who have a page on their portfolio sites with what they're up to right now).

## 2016
* I started 2016 building a new website for a game company using JSP, HTML and CSS. Eventually, the website will need to hook into a payment system and CMS like functionality is on the wish list.
* I got a new job working as a UI Developer. My biggest highlight was building our first library shared between apps.
* I took a letterpress class! I hope to take another one in 2017.
* I am working on building a React app with Seattle Feminist JS, and gave my first talk at one of their meetups.

## 2015
* I had an internship where I developed landing pages and components in the company's React/Node stack using JSX and LESS, tested using React TestUtils and mocha. These components also occasionally interacted with Java and Scala APIs.
* I've been working on Eloquent JavaScript. I know this is more of a beginner book, but it's always nice to go back to basics, especially if you're interviewing.
* I've been getting through Khan Academy's Algorithms course.
* I worked on a Rails app for a crowdfunding website. I used haml and Sass to make front end updates, communicating with the client for feedback on design decisions.
* I've been going to a lot of meetups and hack nights. It's fun to hear talks on different things happening in the web development world
